# Roll Your Own Bootcamp

## The Premise
Participating in an immersive coding bootcamp is a significant financial burden that a majority of working people do not have the privilege of being able to afford. There are numerous aspiring software engineers who do not possess the funds to pay a bootcamp's tuition and are unable to qualify for bank loans or Income Share Agreements. 

## Why Bootcamp is Valuable
I would argue that there is little, if anything, in the technical curriculum of any bootcamp that cannot be learned for free online. If all of that knowledge is readily accessible, what then is the point of spending thousands of dollars on a course to learn these things? As a bootcamp graduate, here is my perspective on what makes a coding bootcamp valuable.

1. In an immersive bootcamp you are forced to code every day. You spend anywhere from eight to twelve hours each day learning and building new things while solidifying your daily practice. 
2. You are assigned mandatory deliverables (homework) that require you to debug issues to completion. 
3. You are surrounded by like-minded individuals with whom you share a common goal. 
4. Finally, bootcamps often offer post cohort outcomes support to help alumni get hired in the industry.

If we break the bootcamp experience down to its composite parts, there is no reason why we cannot attempt to replicate it on our own. While we can't expect to create a facsimile, we can take steps to put our education and development into our own hands. 

## A Note About Starting Small
This article is specifically geared towards folks seeking the intensity of an immersive bootcamp. You absolutely __DO NOT__ have to burn yourself out just to get started with coding. Start small with one book, one youtube video, or one tutorial and just do a little bit each day. Learning to code takes repetition. As long as you are consistent, I promise you that your knowledge will grow. 

## Phase One - Pick Something that Interests You
There are so many different paths to take into the world of programming. Knowing where to start can be very overwhelming. There's web development, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, game development, and so on. Keep in mind that your interests will evolve as you progress and learn more. What you start with may not end up being what you want to do long term. The most important thing is to pick something that interests you enough to motivate you to start. 

Once your interest has been piqued, the next big question is: which language should I learn? There are so many different programming languages to choose from and the choice will largely depend on what you are interested in building. For web development Javascript is a must, for machine learning you can utilize the power of Python, and for game design you have C# and C++. Pick just one language to start and stick with it for _at least_ three to six months. 

>A biased recommendation: I spent the first day of my programming journey attempting to learn Java. As a total beginner, I quickly found myself lost and overwhelmed. The next day, I told a developer friend of mine what I was up to and he suggested that I give Python a try instead. After glancing at Python and discovering how simple its syntax was compared to Java, I obtained a copy of Zed Shaw's excellent book Learn Python the Hard Way and dove in head-first. These days, I do most of my coding in Javacript, but I never would have gotten started if it wasn't for Python. If you want a beginner-friendly language with which to learn the basics, it's hard to beat Python.

## Phase Two - Gather Materials
This step is arguably be the easiest one once you learn where to look. Once you have picked your subject of interest and the language you'd like to learn, it's time to gather learning materials. As long as you have access to an internet connection, you can obtain all of the academic materials you need to teach yourself programming (and a majority of the time you can get them for free.)

### Books
There are many authors and publishers who offer their books free of charge online. A few such books I've utilized during my travels are Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), Marijn Haverbeke's [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), and Aditya Y. Bhargava's [Grokking Algorithms](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/about-this-book/). Of course, offering material for free is not common practice for all publishers and authors. If you can't find the book that you're looking for [Zlibrary](https://z-lib.org/) is a fantastic resource. Zlibrary allows you to download over six million books in various formats free of charge. 
> Out of all of the times I have searched for a title Zlibrary, only twice has that book not been available. I cannot recommend this resource enough. Just make sure to support the authors when you are financially able to do so. 

### Videos
As you probably already know, Youtube is a goldmine of programming content. From short-form, single-subject videos to 12 hour long courses, there are countless content creators making videos on countless subjects and languages. Try searching for your desired language and start building a playlist. Here are a few content creators to get the gears turning: 
- [Caleb Curry](https://www.youtube.com/c/CalebTheVideoMaker2) 
- [CS Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A) 
- [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w) 
- [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWv7vMbMWH4-V0ZXdmDpPBA)

### FreeCodeCamp
[FreeCodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people learn to code for free. They offer curriculum spanning several subjects including web design, data visualization, scientific computing, machine learning, and even interview preparation. Not only is all of the curriculum 100% free, but FreeCodeCamp also provides certifications for each course you complete as well as a user forum where you can connect with other students for debugging and moral support.

### Udemy 
This will be the most expensive suggestion in this article. If you aren't familiar with Udemy, it's an online learning platform with thousands of development courses. Courses normally cost anwhere from $100 to $200, but Udemy frequently runs sales where you can purchase full 50+ hour courses for around $10. [Here is an article](https://skillscouter.com/how-often-does-udemy-have-sales/#comments) that explains when sales are run and how to navigate Udemy in a way that will make the most of your financial resources.

## Phase Three - Outline your Curriculum and Set a Schedule
Once you've secured your learning materials, it's time to start shaping the general outline of your bootcamp curriculum. This part will be a bit tricky when you are first getting started as it is hard to anticipate how much time a given subject will take to learn. Try not to get overly granular with your time-boxing. Don't plan on spending exactly one day on for loops or exactly one week on Express apps. Paint with broader strokes. As a web development example: maybe start with one month of vanilla Javascript, then a month of Node.js and SQL, and then a month of a front end framework like React or Vue. 

Of course, one of the defining characteristics of immersive bootcamps is a rigorous daily schedule. In a full-time immersive, you code for at least eight hours per day, five days per week. Choose which days of the week work for you and __pick a realistic start time__. If you know that you don't work well early in the morning, schedule your time accordingly. Your schedule should challenge you but it should also set you up for success. We're learning to code, not engaging in self-flagellation (although the two activities sometimes feel similar.)

Remember, you absolutely __DO NOT__ have to code eight hours per day and five days per week to get started. You can start with one hour every other day or an hour twice per week. The most important key to success in learning to code is _consistency_. If you decide to do only an hour a day, stick with it. Consistently commit to your coding practice and [surely you will accomplish your goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE). 

## Phase Four - Establish a Support Network

## Phase Five - Build Something
Something I tell the students in my cohort is that there is a huge difference between learning a programming language and learning how to _use_ that programming language. You can master the syntax of a while loop or a ternary statement inside and out, but what really matters is what you can _do_ with those things.

A great part about participating in bootcamp is the mandatory deliverables you are assigned. Having daily deliverables requires you to build something new each day and debug problems to completion without giving up. Push yourself to build something new each day. Your daily deliverables don't have to be groundbreaking. Just keep them simple and focus on the application of what you have learned that day. 

Once a month, spend a week combining the things you have learned to create a larger project. Just like with your deliverables, these do not need to be masterpieces. Perfect is the enemy of good. Just aim to put the things you have learned up until that point together and build something cohesive that brings you joy. 

>Deciding what to build can be just a challenging as building itself. [This Github Repo](https://github.com/karan/Projects) contains a bunch of great project ideas to help get you started.

### A Word About Debugging
When you hit bugs, which you inevitably will, utilize Google, your learning materials, and your support network to debug the problem until it is fixed. Debugging can be exhausting, but it's so vital that you don't give up. Bugs are a natural part of the development process. Even the most seasoned developers deal with bugs on a daily basis. In order to truly be a developer, you have to be courageous in the face of these problems. Getting stuck on a bug doesn't mean that you've failed or that you aren't smart enough. It means you're actually becoming a developer.
