# Roll Your Own Bootcamp

Participating in an immersive coding bootcamp is a significant financial responsibility that many working people do not have the privilege of being able to afford. Even with loans and the advent of the Income Share Agreement, bootcamp is not a realistic option for many aspiring developers. That said, I would argue that there is little, if anything, in the technical curriculum of _any_ bootcamp that cannot be learned for free online. If all of that knowledge is readily accessible, then what is the point of spending thousands of dollars on a course to learn these things? As a bootcamp graduate, here is my perspective on the big things that make a coding bootcamp valuable:

- In an immersive bootcamp you are forced to code every day. You spend anywhere from eight to twelve hours each day learning and building new things and solidifying your daily practice. 
- You are assigned mandatory deliverables (homework) that require you to debug issues to completion. 
- You are surrounded by like-minded individuals with whom you share a common goal. 

If we break the bootcamp experience down to its composite parts, there is no reason why we cannot attempt to replicate it on our own. While we can't expect to create a facsimile, we can take steps to put our education and development into our own hands. 

## A Note About Starting Small
This article is specifically geared towards folks seeking the intensity of an immersive bootcamp. You absolutely __DO NOT__ have to burn yourself out just to get started with coding. Start small with one book, one youtube video, or one tutorial and just do a little bit each day. Learning to code takes repetition. As long as you are consistent, I promise you that your knowledge will grow. 

## Phase One - Pick Something that Interests You
There are so many different paths to take into the world of programming. Knowing where to start can be very overwhelming. There's web development, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, game development, and so on. Keep in mind that what you start with may not end up being what you want to do long term. Your interests will shift and evolve as you progress. The most important thing to do at first is to pick something that interests you enough to serve as motivation to start.

Once you've found an area that piques your interest, the next big question is generally: which programming language should I learn? There are so many different programming languages to choose from and the choice will largely depend on what you are interested in building. For web development Javascript is a must, for machine learning you can utilize the power of Python, and for game design you have C# and C++. Do some research on what people actually use. [Here is a chart that ranks programming language popularity by the amount of Github pull requests](https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2020/4). Pick just one language to start (HTML and CSS don't count) and stick with it. 

>A biased recommendation: I spent the first day of my programming journey attempting to learn Java. As a total beginner, I quickly found myself lost and overwhelmed. The next day, I told a developer friend of mine what I was up to and he suggested that I give Python a try instead. After glancing at Python and discovering how simple its syntax was compared to Java, I obtained a copy of Zed Shaw's excellent book [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/) and dove in head-first. These days, I do most of my coding in Javacript, but I never would have gotten started if it wasn't for Python. If you want a beginner-friendly language with which to learn the basics, it's hard to beat Python.

## Phase Two - Gather Materials
This step is arguably be the easiest one once you learn where to look. Once you have picked your subject of interest and the language you'd like to learn, it's time to gather your learning materials. As long as you have access to an internet connection you can obtain all of the academic materials you need to teach yourself programming (and 99% of the time you can get them for free.)

### Books
There are many authors and publishers who offer their books free of charge online. A few such books I've utilized during my travels are Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), Marijn Haverbeke's [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), and Aditya Y. Bhargava's [Grokking Algorithms](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/about-this-book/). Of course, offering material for free is not common practice for all publishers and authors. If you can't find the book that you're looking for [Zlibrary](https://z-lib.org/) is a fantastic resource. Zlibrary allows you to download over six million books in various formats free of charge. 
> Out of all of the titles I have searched for on Zlibrary, only twice has the book not been available. I cannot recommend this resource enough. Just make sure to show good form and support the authors when you are financially able to do so. 

### Videos
As you probably already know, Youtube is a goldmine of programming content. From short-form, single-subject videos to 12 hour long courses, there are countless creators making videos on countless subjects and languages. Try searching for your language and start building a playlist. Here are a few content creators I have found helpful to get you started: 
- [Caleb Curry](https://www.youtube.com/c/CalebTheVideoMaker2) 
- [CS Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A) 
- [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w) 
- [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWv7vMbMWH4-V0ZXdmDpPBA)

### FreeCodeCamp
[FreeCodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people learn to code for free. They offer curriculum spanning several subjects including web design, data visualization, scientific computing, machine learning, and even interview preparation. Not only is all of the curriculum 100% free, but FreeCodeCamp also provides certifications for each course you complete as well as a user forum where you can connect with other students for debugging and moral support. If you would benefit from a structured, ready-made curriculum, FreeCodeCamp is an excellent resource. 

### Udemy 
This will be the most expensive suggestion in this article. If you aren't familiar with Udemy, it's an online learning platform with thousands of development courses. Courses normally cost anwhere from $100 to $200, but Udemy frequently runs sales where you can purchase full 50+ hour courses for around $10. [Here is an article](https://skillscouter.com/how-often-does-udemy-have-sales/#comments) that explains when sales are run and how to navigate Udemy in a way that will make the most of your financial resources.

## Phase Three - Outline your Curriculum and Set a Schedule
Once you've secured your learning materials, it's time to start shaping the outline of your bootcamp curriculum. This part will be a bit tricky when you are first getting started as it is hard to anticipate how much time a given subject will take to learn. Try not to get overly granular with your time-boxing. Don't plan on spending exactly one day on for loops or exactly one week on Express apps. Paint with broader strokes. As a web development example: maybe start with one month of vanilla Javascript, then a month of Node.js and SQL, and then a month of a front end framework like React or Vue. 

Of course, one of the defining characteristics of immersive bootcamps is a rigorous daily schedule. In a full-time immersive, you code for at least eight hours per day, five or more days per week. Choose which days of the week work for you and __pick a realistic start time__. If you know that you don't work well early in the morning, schedule your time accordingly. Your schedule should challenge you but it should also set you up for success. We're learning to code, not engaging in self-flagellation (although the two activities will sometimes feel similar.)

Remember, you absolutely __DO NOT__ have to code eight hours per day and five days per week to get started. You can start with one hour every other day or an hour twice per week. As stated before, the most important key to success in learning to code is _consistency_. If you decide to do only an hour every day, actually do an hour every day. Consistently commit to your coding practice and [surely you will accomplish your goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE). 

## Phase Four - Establish a Support Network
As with any change of lifestyle or habit, it is easier to sustain a coding practice when you are surrounded by like-minded people. Whether you need extra eyes on a troublesome bug or someone to talk to about imposter syndrome, it is vital to establish a support network for your bootcamp journey. Luckily, there is no shortage of resources to connect with like-minded people on the internet. This process is fairly self-explanatory, but here are a few places to start:

- Reddit has many different subreddits for different languages and subjects (the folks over at [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/) were a huge help to me when I first got started.) 
- If you are utilizing FreeCodeCamp, they have a [fantastic user forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) that has sections for each subject in their curriculum, a section for project feedback, as well as a section for motivation and encouragement. 
- Similarly to FreeCodeCamp, many educators on Udemy also offer community Discord servers to accompany their courses (for example, Maximilian Schwarzmüller's [Academind](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/) has a bustling community of learners.) 
- [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) is full of local and global groups dedicated to various topics. Being that all Meetups are currently taking place remotely, you are not limited to groups within driving distace. [Junior Developer Happy Hour](https://www.meetup.com/Junior-Developer-Happy-Hour/) is a great group to check out.
- [Lunchclub](https://lunchclub.com/) is a networking service that helps you meet people via hour-long, one-on-one lunch meetings via video chat. You let Lunchclub know about your background and interests and their AI connects you with new people each week.

## Phase Five - Build Something
There is a huge difference between learning a programming language and learning how to _use_ that programming language to build something. You can master the syntax of a while loop or a ternary statement inside and out, but what really matters is what you can _do_ with those things.

A great part about participating in bootcamp is the mandatory deliverables you are assigned. Having daily deliverables requires you to build something new each day and debug problems to completion without giving up. Push yourself to build something new each day. Your daily deliverables don't have to be groundbreaking. Just keep them simple and focus on the application of what you have learned that day. 

Once a month, aim to spend a week combining the things you have learned to create a larger project. Just like with your deliverables, these do not need to be masterpieces. Perfect is the enemy of good. Just aim to put the things you have learned up until that point together and build something cohesive that brings you joy. 

>Deciding what to build can be just a challenging as building itself. Most books on programming will include exercises and assignments, but if you need a little extra inspiration, [this Github repo](https://github.com/karan/Projects) contains a bunch of great project ideas to help get you started.

## A Word About Debugging
When you hit bugs, which you inevitably will, utilize Google, your learning materials, and your support network to debug the problem until it is fixed. When you hit a bug __Google early and Google often.__ Ninety-nine times out of a hundred someone else on the internet has run into the same problem. Between Stack Overflow and documentation, the solution to your problem is most likely a Google search or two away. 
In the rare instance that you can't find what you're looking for, don't be afraid to ask folks on the internet for help. It's scary to put yourself out there, but remember that every single developer in the world was a beginner at one point too. It may surprise you just how generous folks are in helping developers when they are just starting out. 
Debugging can be exhausting, but it's so vital that you don't give up. Bugs are a natural part of the development process. Even the most seasoned developers deal with bugs on a daily basis. In order to truly become a developer, you have to be courageous in the face of these problems. Getting stuck on a bug doesn't mean that you've failed or that you aren't smart enough. It means you're actually becoming a developer. Remember: __Google Early and Google Often__. [Here is an article](https://blog.hartleybrody.com/debugging-code-beginner/) with some great tips on debugging code for beginners.

## Wrapping Up
You don't need to be enrolled in bootcamp to learn to code. There is no subject in the technical curriculum of any coding bootcamp that can't be learned for free online. That said, it's not as simple as just reading a book or buying a course. You'll have to be consistent and push yourself. If you decide you're going to code, even if it's just for an hour a day, you have to actually do it (even on the days when you really don't want to.) If you set achievable goals and stay consistent you can begin your coding journey in earnest.
