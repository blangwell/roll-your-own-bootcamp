# Roll your own Bootcamp

## The Premise
Participating in an immersive coding bootcamp is a significant financial burden that a majority of working people do not have the privilege of being able to afford. There are numerous aspiring software engineers who do not possess the funds to pay a bootcamp's tuition and are unable to qualify for bank loans or Income Share Agreements. 

## Why Bootcamp is Valuable
I would argue that there is little, if anything, in the technical curriculum of any bootcamp that cannot be learned for free online. If all of that knowledge is readily accessible, what then is the point of spending thousands of dollars on a course to learn these things? As a bootcamp graduate, here is my perspective on what makes a coding bootcamp valuable.

1. In an immersive bootcamp you are forced to code every day. You spend anywhere from eight to twelve hours each day learning and building new things while solidifying your daily practice. 
2. You are assigned mandatory deliverables (homework) that require you to debug issues to completion. 
3. You are surrounded by like-minded individuals with whom you share a common goal. 
4. Finally, bootcamps often offer post cohort outcomes support to help alumni get hired in the industry.

If we break the bootcamp experience down to its composite parts, there is no reason why we cannot attmept to replicate it on our own. While we can't expect to create a facsimile, we can take steps to put our education and development into our own hands. 

## A Note About Starting Small
This article is specifically geared towards folks seeking the intensity of an immersive bootcamp. You absolutely __DO NOT__ have to burn yourself out just to get started with coding. Start small with one book, one youtube video, or one tutorial and just do a little bit each day. Learning to code takes repetition. As long as you are consistent, I promise you that your knowledge will grow.
