# Roll your own Bootcamp

## The Premise
Participating in an immersive coding bootcamp is a significant financial burden that a majority of working people do not have the privilege of being able to afford. There are numerous aspiring software engineers who do not possess the funds to pay a bootcamp's tuition and are unable to qualify for bank loans or Income Share Agreements. 

## Why Bootcamp is Valuable
I would argue that there is little, if anything, in the technical curriculum of any bootcamp that cannot be learned for free online. If all of that knowledge is readily accessible, what then is the value of spending thousands of dollars on a course to learn these things? 

As a bootcamp graduate, here is my perspective. In an immersive bootcamp you are forced to adopt coding as a daily practice for eight to twelve hours a day. You are assigned mandatory deliverables (homework) that require you to debug issues to completion and build something new each day. Finally, bootcamp surrounds you with like-minded individuals with whom you share a common goal.
